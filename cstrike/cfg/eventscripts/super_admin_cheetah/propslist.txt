// This is the props that can be found in props menu
// Props menu can be accessed through main menu, which is opened with the command chosen in config.cfg - usually /sac

// The syntax is: "type" "prop name" "prop path"
// Type can be either "D" for dynamic, or "P" for physic
// The " are VERY important, if you don't include them, the line will be handled as a comment.
// It also needs to have exactly 6 of those " (apostrophe), otherwise it will be handled as a comment aswell.

// Will work: "D" "Sound1" "music/Ravenholm_1.mp3"
// Won't work: D Sound1 music/Ravenholm_1.mp3

// The sound is from INSIDE models/ folder, so:
// "cstrike/models/props_vehicles/apc001.mdl" would simply be "props_vehicles/apc001.mdl"

// Good, now let's get started.
