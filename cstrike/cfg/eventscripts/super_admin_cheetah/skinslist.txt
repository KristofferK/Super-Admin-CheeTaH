// This is the skins that can be found in skins menu
// skins menu can be accessed through Main Menu->Fun Commands, which is opened with the command chosen in config.cfg - usually /sac

// The syntax is: "prop name" "prop path"
// The " are VERY important, if you don't include them, the line will be handled as a comment.
// It also needs to have exactly 4 of those " (apostrophe), otherwise it will be handled as a comment aswell.

// Will work: "Antlion" "antlion"
// Won't work: Antlion antlion

// The path is from INSIDE models/ folder, so:
// "cstrike/models/props_vehicles/apc001.mdl" would simply be "props_vehicles/apc001.mdl"

// Good, now let's get started.
