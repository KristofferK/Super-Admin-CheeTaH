// This is a list of banned users.
// This file shouldn't be edited manually, script will do it for you.

// The syntax is |SteamID|Banned|Banner|TimeRemaining|TimeBanned|*
// * SteamID = SteamID of the banner player
// * Banned = Name of the banned player
// * Banner = Name of the player that banned a person
// * TimeRemaining = Minutes left before he can play again. 0 = Permanent
// * TimeBanned = For how long time he originally was banned.

// A line has to start with |[U: otherwise the script will think it is a comment
// A line also needs exactly 6 of those: |
